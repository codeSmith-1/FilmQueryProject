# FilmQueryProject

## Description
The film query application allows users to search films by id or keywords. 
The resulting film(s) list pertinent details like title, description, rating, and actors. If users search by film ID, they access a submenu 
which allows them to view all data related to the film. Users can return from these menus and continue to search by id or keywords. 

## Technology Used
The application is written in Java and uses Maven to import standard SQL dependencies allowing Java can query the database for pertinent information.

## Lessons Learned
Joining tables and refining SQL queries were the biggest hurdles in this project. For example, this application appends an array of actors from the actor table to the film table data.
